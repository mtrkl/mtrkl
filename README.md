## About Me

Hello! I'm Mehmet, I'm currently a student at Kozmos Software Engineering Anatolian High School.
I started learning programming when I was around 11-12, starting out with C. I was gifted `The C Programming Language (ANSI C)` book for my birthday. (An original copy!)

After that, since my school at the time wasn't focused on anything related to programming; I decided to "script" (equivalent of code) on a game I played alot, (and I still do sometimes), Roblox.
I've been scripting in Roblox since then, having around 2 years of rLua under my belt. 

After starting out at KSEAHS, I quickly made friends with someone (will link their github once they make it) who was an excellent programmer. They were more web-focused, and had alot of Cybersecurity knowledge & experience.
I learned;
* HTTP/HTTPS
* C#
* C++
* Swift  
* JavaScript
* Java    
* Python
* SQL
* PHP
 
in a single year! I may not be a 100% expert on all of them, but I'd consider myself "able to do whatever I want" in them. *I love Swift and C++ though!*

Now, in the 10th grade; I've picked Cybersecurity as my subject of choice and hope to progress; I've learned (and am learning) about the Fundamentals of Cybersecurity, Open Source Operating Systems, and Networks.

If I could describe myself in a quote, it would be:
> "I actually hate programming, but I love solving problems."
> 
>  *- Rasmus Lerdorf, Creator of PHP*
